## Test

> - **Start preparing your slides for the oral exam.**
> - For [CICD](https://bmw.ece.ntust.edu.tw/docs/page/project-alpha/Study%20Notes/study-note-thesis-roadmap#1-bimo-cicd-discussion)
>   1. Add a section showing the challenges of CI/CD.
> - For [Worker Node](https://bmw.ece.ntust.edu.tw/docs/page/project-alpha/Study%20Notes/study-note-thesis-roadmap#worker-node-specifications)
>   1. Switch the NIC from worker-rt-01 to lavoisier and let lavoisier be worker-rt-01
> - For [srsRAN - LiteON C3](https://bmw.ece.ntust.edu.tw/docs/page/project-alpha/Study%20Notes/study-note-thesis-roadmap#srsran---liteon-c3)
>   1. Email sent to srsRAN team: Oct 21
>      1. Check it and update he status EVERY WEEK
> - For [Experiment Planning](https://bmw.ece.ntust.edu.tw/docs/page/project-alpha/Study%20Notes/study-note-experiment-design), please
>   1. list the contribution of this paper
>   2. tell us the design goal of each experiment,
>   3. why these goals can demonstrate your contribution in a,
>   4. and how you designed your experiment to achieve your goal in b.
>   5. Some issues to be clarified
>      1. Assume: 3 O-RU, what are the RUs you plan to use
>      2. [Bandwidth Scaling](https://bmw.ece.ntust.edu.tw/docs/page/project-alpha/Study%20Notes/study-note-experiment-design#bandwidth-scaling): Why do you only consider SCS=30 kHz but not 15 kHz
>      3. How do you set these values?
>         1. [PTP Loss](https://bmw.ece.ntust.edu.tw/docs/page/project-alpha/Study%20Notes/study-note-experiment-design#ptp-grandmaster-failure-recovery) (s): 30 and 60, should we aim to find the maximum value of PTP Loss?
>         2. [Link Down](https://bmw.ece.ntust.edu.tw/docs/page/project-alpha/Study%20Notes/study-note-experiment-design#fronthaul-link-interruption) (s):  10 and 30, should we aim to find the maximum value of Link Down?
>         3. [Memory Stress](https://bmw.ece.ntust.edu.tw/docs/page/project-alpha/Study%20Notes/study-note-experiment-design#qos-protection-under-memory-preassure): how do you set the memory stress? how do you select the QoS class?
>         4. [CPU Core Offline](https://bmw.ece.ntust.edu.tw/docs/page/project-alpha/Study%20Notes/study-note-experiment-design#cpu-core-offline): 1 and 2 cores
